Explanations:

I chose to explicitly default all the big five class functions
(destructor, copy ctr., move ctr., copy assignment, and move assignment)
in the abstract class Fractal, and in all of its subclasses.
I chose to default these because all of the data members in those classes are of primitive types,
and none are dynamically allocated.

I chose to implement the drawing of a Fractal ASCII Art in the following way:
once the method draw() is called on a Fractal instance, a 2D array of characters is allocated
(and pointed to by a local pointer variable) and passed by reference to the helper methods
which build, print and delete it.
